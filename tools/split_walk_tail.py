"""Split the walking body plate into a tail-free body and a tail layer so the
tail can sway about its root while Rongxin walks.

The cut runs down the rump. The tail keeps everything right of the cut and is
fully opaque up to 20 px inside the body; the body keeps everything left of the
cut and fades out over 30 px past it. Tail is drawn first, body last, so the
overlap stays opaque and the body's own fur hides the tail's cut edge."""
